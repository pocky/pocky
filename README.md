### Oh! HAI! 👋

Hello, I am Alex(andre) "pocky" Balmes and I try to work and contribute on OSS projects. I am a big fan of architecture (DDD/Hexa/Clean) even if I don't have any problems with RAD. I also love Sylius and Symfony.

It is also possible to find me on my [blog](https://write.vanoix.com/alexandre) in 🇫🇷 or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pockystar)

I have created [akawaka](https://www.akawaka.fr)

### How to help me?

#### Contribute! 🔥
If you think there is something to add to my projects, feel free to create an issue and ping me (hard) because of my profesionnal position.

#### Hire me 👨‍💻
The best way to help me is to hire us on akawaka for your Symfony and/or your Sylius projects.
